- Added logouts using a menu in toolbar, you can disregard
the "Logout" button on the landing activity, that was used for debugging
- Added rent splitting activity, but need to add scrollviews and etc. after groups are
implemented
- Deleted some minor things also, idk if they're required, if so please lmk:
    - Deleted the "finish()" after launching chores activity since we want users to
      go back to the main menu
-Implemented a progress bar on logins + create accounts, thinking about implementing this to
 chores? idk.
