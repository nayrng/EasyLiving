CHANGELOG:
5/30/2019 - Ryan Ng
- New users have to join a group before going to the landing page. Will work on giving users an option to either join or create a group.
- Fixed bug that would cause the landing page to say "Welcome home, null" instead of "Welcome home, <USERNAME>" when a new account is created
- Fixed bug that would cause Split Bills to crash when inserting a new item
5/28/2019 - Chuangbo Tong
- minor changes on UI
5/26/2019 - Brix Tanhueco
- One thing that was causing us huge issues was Firebase, it often changes the field key name (like changing groupName to groupname)
- I'm unsure if this is still an issue, but lol who tf knows. 
- Added some basic logic shit when it comes to joining a group, you can't join a group you're already in, but u can still join other's groups
- But if you join other's groups, the rules for chores become more difficult, so lol.

- Created a new "Payments" Object, this should handle rent splitting / supplies price division
- We should consider implementing an activity with multiple tabs to view charges, view people who haven't paid you, your running total, etc. 
- Consider implementing a checkbox into payments also
- Probably gonna implement "open Venmo" etc. 
5/21/2019 - Chuangbo Tong
- Implemented supply page, so now you could add and delete supplies from that page, and you could specify the user, the quantity and price of
the supply.
- Found the issue in Joining groups and create groups that would cause an casting error, I fixed it but whenever joining groups it would 
enter an infinite loop that keeps adding the current user to that group account in firebase, but my laptop broke so I couldn't do anything
about it.

5/19/2019 - Brix Joshua Tanhueco
- IMPLEMENTATION IDEA: We should probably prompt the user to either join a group or create a group on sign in
- IMPLEMENTATION IDEA: We should prob still create a database with "user nodes" to check if they're in a group
- ERROR: I noticed that once a user starts the chore activity, the chores don't pop up at first.
- FIXED: Added password checking into groups

- CHANGED: Changed the GROUP type user arrayList to STRING instead of the raw user value. This allowed for password checking but fucked up 
--something in the ChoresACtivity? <-Jk looks like I fixed it by wiping the database and changing some map code


5/18/2019 - Ryan Ng
- Changed the group data structure
    - Originally groups had 3 fields, "ADMIN", "groupName", "groupPass"
        - Added an ArrayList field called "users" that has all the members of a group
        - Also added an ArrayList field called "chores" that was supposed to reference the chores, but I'll probably end up removing it later,
        havent used it at all       
- Added a join group functionality
- Made changes to "ChoresActivity.java" and "CHORES_OBJECT.java"
    - Added an extra field in the CHORES_OBJECT: a group ID
    - Now in the chores activity, users can only see chores that were inputted from users in their same group

5/17/2018 - Brix Joshua Tanhueco
- Added logouts using a menu in toolbar, you can disregard
the "Logout" button on the landing activity, that was used for debugging
- Added rent splitting activity, but need to add scrollviews and etc. after groups are
implemented
- Deleted some minor things also, idk if they're required, if so please lmk:
    - Deleted the "finish()" after launching chores activity since we want users to
      go back to the main menu
-Implemented a progress bar on logins + create accounts, thinking about implementing this to
 chores? idk.
-Created "groups" but having difficulty accessing the "Users"
