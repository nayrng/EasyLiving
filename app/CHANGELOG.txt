CHANGELOG:
5/19/2019 - Brix Joshua Tanhueco
- IMPLEMENTATION IDEA: We should probably prompt the user to either join a group or create a group on sign in
- IMPLEMENTATION IDEA: We should prob still create a database with "user nodes" to check if they're in a group
- ERROR: I noticed that once a user starts the chore activity, the chores don't pop up at first.
- FIXED: Added password checking into groups

5/18/2019 - Ryan Ng
- Changed the group data structure
    - Originally groups had 3 fields, "ADMIN", "groupName", "groupPass"
        - Added an ArrayList field called "users" that has all the members of a group
        - Also added an ArrayList field called "chores" that was supposed to reference the chores, but I'll probably end up removing it later,
        havent used it at all       
- Added a join group functionality
- Made changes to "ChoresActivity.java" and "CHORES_OBJECT.java"
    - Added an extra field in the CHORES_OBJECT: a group ID
    - Now in the chores activity, users can only see chores that were inputted from users in their same group

5/17/2018 - Brix Joshua Tanhueco
- Added logouts using a menu in toolbar, you can disregard
the "Logout" button on the landing activity, that was used for debugging
- Added rent splitting activity, but need to add scrollviews and etc. after groups are
implemented
- Deleted some minor things also, idk if they're required, if so please lmk:
    - Deleted the "finish()" after launching chores activity since we want users to
      go back to the main menu
-Implemented a progress bar on logins + create accounts, thinking about implementing this to
 chores? idk.
-Created "groups" but having difficulty accessing the "Users"
